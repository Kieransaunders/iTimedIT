# Expo Monorepo Configuration
# See: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/monorepos/

# Use legacy peer deps to handle React Native peer dependency conflicts
# Required for React 19 + React Native 0.81 compatibility
legacy-peer-deps=true

# Use hoisted installation strategy (recommended for React Native)
# This setting works for pnpm - npm uses hoisted by default
# If using pnpm, this prevents isolated dependency issues with React Native
node-linker=hoisted

# Engine strict - warn but don't fail on engine mismatches
# (Some React Native packages require Node >= 20.19.4, we have 20.19.0)
engine-strict=false
